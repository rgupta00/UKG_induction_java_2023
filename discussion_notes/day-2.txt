Introduction to Object Oriented Principles


Can we have private ctr inside the class?
yes 
then how to use it?






Reference:
===========
to listen:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_hoSFpYsG4&list=PLv2-IhRmhbySgIQo3rH8KnclTSOYAp2xG&index=4

if not comfortable 




Visiblity modifier:

public protected defult private 

What is the diff bw protected defult


if i have a procted data/method in one class in a package

that data/method is accessable to other package iff
other package class ...subclass it









Day 2:
=========
Quick recap of day 1:

basics of java

JDK VS JVM VS JRE

class 
object
methods
access modifiers


What next?

Call by value vs call by refrence

relationship bw the objects
==============================

		A trainer is using marker while teaching
		

class Marker{
}

class Trainer  {
	public void teach(Marker m){
	}
}


	A pond have 5 duckes 2 is black and 3 is white
	

class Duck{
	private String color;
	public Duck(String color){

real life code example on interface and abstract class







Example of inheritance

1.
 Employee
 	id name salary
 	
2.	
 FullTimeEmployee
 	id name salary, ppfNo
 	
 
3.
 PartTimeEmployee
 	id name salary, noOfDays, salaryPerDay
 	
 	
4. main
------------
Create two emp one is ft and one is pt and create the object and print there state


5.
PaymentProcessingSystem
	employees
	
	

	
* should not Employee is an abstract class



6. you need to process salary for consulant(inteface) 

* Invoice
